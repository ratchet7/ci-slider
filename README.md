ci-slider
=========

A confidence interval slider written for Python web applications. Used in a political ideology paper.

Allows users to report a 95% confidence interval along with their ideology point estimate.

This has been stripped out of an Apache server and so will require some back-end wizardry to adapt for other projects.
